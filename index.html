        <p>Bio: My name is Alex and I am currently attending Arizona
          State University set to graduate in May 2020. As far as
          interests go, my music tastes vary from Black Sabbath to
          Migos, I am a big sports fan, but I mostly
          follow Hockey. I do not know where I am going to end up in this
          field, but currently I am interested in working for companies
          that work with energy such as SRP or APS for example.</p>
